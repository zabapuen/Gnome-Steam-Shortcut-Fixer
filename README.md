# Gnome Steam Shortcuts Utility

Simple utility to fix Steam shortcuts so the icon of the games RUNNING WITH PROTON is displayed correctly on GNOME instead of the default 'no icon' program.
Can also be used to generate shortcuts for ALL your installed Steam games at once.
Note that the utility will fix the icon of games running with Proton and also apply this fix to native games, but the fix will only work with games running with Proton. For native games you can manually change the value of `StartupWMClass` in the .desktop file to the name of the executable. For exemple, for the game `Enter the Gungeon` you should put `StartupWMClass=EtG.x86_64`. Unfortunately this cannot be automated the same way as Proton games because it does not follow a pattern like them.

Shortcut creation WILL overwrite existing Steam games shortcuts but will not change shortcuts unrelated to Steam.
If the icon of the game is not found / doesn't exist it will default to the Steam icon.

Utility tested on 2 PCs with GNOME 47 on Nobara 41 and Fedora 41.
